# GitLab Hook Server

This self-contained web server listens for web hook `POST` requests from an
on-premise [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) server. Hooks can be filtered
and configured with custom actions to be performed if a filter is satisfied.

Some examples s'il vous pla√Æt:

 * Execute tests when a merge request is created
 * Deploy an application when a tag is created
 * Deploy Puppet modules with `r10k` when a branch is updated
 * Send an email whenever an issue is created

The project is a __work-in-progress__ and remains unreleased.
